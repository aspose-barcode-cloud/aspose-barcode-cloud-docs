## **Overview**

This article describes the steps required to utilize the Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for Java to linear barcodes.

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- An Aspose Cloud account. If not, sign up for free on the Aspose website.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Apache Maven for managing dependencies (optional).


## **How to Generate 1D Barcodes**

1. Set up Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for Java. Start by setting up a Java project in your chosen Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Integrate the Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for Java into your project. You can do this manually by downloading the SDK from the Aspose website or by using a dependency management tool like Apache Maven.

2. Authenticate with your Aspose Cloud account by obtaining your App Key and App SID from the Aspose Cloud dashboard. Use these credentials to initialize the Barcode object, enabling communication with the Aspose.BarCode Cloud service.

3. Generate linear barcodes. Once authenticated, you can proceed to generate linear barcodes of different types. Aspose.BarCode SDK for Java supports various linear barcode types such as Code 39, Code 128, EAN-13, UPC-A, and more. Invoke the appropriate method provided by the SDK, specifying the barcode type, data to encode, and any additional parameters required. Additionally, you may customize the appearance of the barcode by adjusting parameters such as width, height, font, and colors.

4. After generating the barcode, the response will contain the barcode image data. You can save this image to a local file or perform additional processing as necessary.
