## **Overview**

This article describes the steps required to utilize the Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for .NET to create 2D barcodes.

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- An Aspose Cloud account. You can sign up for free on the Aspose website.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.


## **How to Generate 2D Barcodes**

1. Set up Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for .NET. Begin by creating a new .NET project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Integrate the Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for .NET into your project. You can do this by installing the SDK package via NuGet Package Manager or by manually downloading and referencing the SDK assembly.
2. Authenticate with your Aspose Cloud account by obtaining your App Key and App SID from the Aspose Cloud dashboard. Use these credentials to initialize the barcode object, enabling communication with the Aspose.BarCode Cloud service.
3. Generate 2D barcodes. Once authenticated, you can proceed to generate 2D barcodes of different types. Aspose.BarCode SDK for .NET supports various 2D barcode types such as QR Code, DataMatrix, PDF417, and more. Call the appropriate method provided by the SDK, specifying the barcode type, data to encode, and any other parameters required. Additionally, you may customize the appearance of the barcode by adjusting parameters such as width, height, error correction level, and colors.
4. Save the generated barcode. After generating the barcode, the response will contain the barcode image data. You can save this image to a local file or perform additional processing as necessary.
