## **Overview**

This article describes the steps required to utilize the Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for .NET to create postal barcodes.

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- An Aspose Cloud account. You can sign up for free on the Aspose website.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.


## **How to Generate Postal Barcodes**

1. Set up Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for .NET. Start by initiating a new .NET project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Integrate the Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for .NET into your project. This can be accomplished by installing the SDK package via NuGet Package Manager or by manually downloading and referencing the SDK assembly.

2. Authenticate with your Aspose Cloud account by acquiring your App Key and App SID from the Aspose Cloud dashboard. Utilize these credentials to initialize the barcode object, enabling communication with the Aspose.BarCode Cloud service.

3. Generate postal barcodes. Once authenticated, proceed to generate postal barcodes of different types. Aspose.BarCode SDK for .NET supports various postal barcode types such as USPS Intelligent Mail, Royal Mail, Australia Post, and more. Invoke the appropriate method provided by the SDK, specifying the barcode type, data to encode, and any additional parameters required.

4. Handle the generated barcode. Upon successful generation, the response will contain the barcode image data. Save this image to a local file or perform additional processing as necessary.
