## **Overview**

This article describes the steps required to utilize the Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for .NET to create linear barcodes.

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- An Aspose Cloud account. You can sign up for free on the Aspose website.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.


## **How to Generate 1D Barcodes**
1. Set up Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for .NET. Begin by creating a new .NET project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Integrate the Aspose.BarCode Cloud SDK for .NET into your project. You can achieve this by installing the SDK package via NuGet Package Manager or by manually downloading and referencing the SDK assembly.

2. Authenticate with Aspose Cloud. Authenticate with your Aspose Cloud account by obtaining your App Key and App SID from the Aspose Cloud dashboard. Use these credentials to initialize the barcode object, enabling communication with the Aspose.BarCode Cloud service.

3. Generate linear barcodes. Once authenticated, you can proceed to generate linear barcodes of different types. Aspose.BarCode SDK for .NET supports various linear barcode types such as Code 39, Code 128, EAN-13, UPC-A, and more. Invoke the appropriate method provided by the SDK, specifying the barcode type, data to encode, and any additional parameters required. You may customize the appearance of the barcode by adjusting parameters such as width, height, font, and colors.

4. Save the generated barcode. After generating the barcode, the response will contain the barcode image data. You can save this image to a local file or perform additional processing as necessary.
